# Part 1

## Question 1

values added: 20

## Question 2

final result: 20

## Question 3

values added: 20

## Question 4

The code returns an error because `result` was declared using `let` so `result` is only visible within the block of code contained by the `if` statement. Line 13 is not within this block of code, so the variable `result` is not visible.

## Question 5

The code will return an error. `result` is declared as a constant, so it cannot be reassigned and line 7 will give an error.

## Question 6

The code will return an error. `result` is declared as a constant and cannot be reassigned, so an error will occur in line 7.
